# Upgrade

  For an updated version of the upgrade documentation, visit https://wiki.litecart.net/how_to_upgrade.

  Upgrade from any previous master release version of LiteCart. The upgrade procedure will sort out and apply all necessary version patches.

  Note: Add-ons are version specific and might cause your upgraded platform to malfunction. Make sure all your add-ons are up to date.

### Instructions

  1. Backup your files AND database!! Do not underestimate the damage that can be caused by a failed upgrade process.

2. **Upload the contents of the folder public_html/** to the corresponding path of your installation **replacing the current files**. Any modified files will be overwritten!

   If you have renamed your admin/ folder, make sure the files of the admin/ folder are uploaded to the right place.

  3. Point your browser to http://www.yoursite.com/install/upgrade.php and follow the instructions on the page.

  4. Make sure everything went fine and delete the install/ folder.

     If there are complications, try switching to the default template and disable any vQmods.
