# Upgrade

  Upgrade from any previous master release version of LiteCart. The upgrade procedure will sort out and apply all necessary version patches.

  Note: Add-ons are version specific and might cause your upgraded platform to malfunction. Make sure all your add-ons are up to date.

### Instructions

  1. Backup your files AND database!! Do not underestimate the damage that can be caused by a failed upgrade process.

  2. Upload the contents of the folder public_html/* to the corresponding path of your installation replacing the old files. Any modified files will be overwritten!

  3. Point your browser to http://www.yoursite.com/install/upgrade.php and follow the instructions on the page.

  4. Make sure everything went fine and delete the install/ folder.

     If there are complications, try switching to the default template and disable any vQmods.
