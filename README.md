----------------------------------------------------------------------

LiteCart is a lightweight e-commerce platform for online merchants. Developed in PHP, HTML 5, and CSS 3.

LiteCart is a registered trademark, property of founder T. Almroth - [TiM International](http://www.tim-international.net).

# How To Install

  What you need:

  * An Apache2 web server running PHP 5.3 or higher. PHP 7.1+ recommended for best performance.
  * A MySQL 5.5+ account.

  If you don't have access to a web server and want to try LiteCart on your local machine, check out [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/). AMPPS is an Apache web server suite that offers LiteCart for installation with one click using Softaculous.

  Instructions
  ------------

  Please note running your own website requires some common sense of web knowledge. If this is not your area of expertise, ask a friend or collegue to assist you.

  1. Connect to your web host via FTP using your favourite FTP software.

  2. Transfer the contents of the folder public_html/ in this archive (yes the contents inside the folder - not the folder itself). Transfer it to your website root directory. Using subdirectories is supported but not recommended.

      Example:

      /var/www/

      /home/username/public_html/

      C:\xampp\htdocs\

  Paths are machine specific, so talk to your web host if you are uncertain where this folder is.

  3. Point your web browser to the URL of your website followed by the subfolder install/ e.g. http://www.mysite.com/install/. If you placed LiteCart in a subfolder of the web root, the path should be something like http://www.mysite.com/litecart/install. The installation page should now load.

  4. Carefully read the instructions on the page. Fill in your details for database, region, etc. Click the Install button when you are ready.

  If everything went well LiteCart should be successfully installed.

  Get Started
  -----------

  To get your store up and running, see our [step list](https://wiki.litecart.net/doku.php?id=get_started) for best practise.

  How To Change The Look Of Your Store
  ------------------------------------

  Navigate to the folder ~/includes/templates/default.catalog/ and you will find all HTML content and CSS files to edit. If you want to adapt your work with LESS instead of CSS you will need a LESS compiler. We recommend downloading our [Developer Kit](https://www.litecart.net/addons/163/developer-kit) that has a preconfigured LESS compiler and JavaScript minifyer.
