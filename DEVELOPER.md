This project uses Node + Grunt to compile less to css among other things.
To install Grunt do the following:

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

2. In your LiteCart project folder (next to package.json) create the file "Run Node.cmd" with the following content:

    @C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files\nodejs\nodevars.bat"

3. Execute "Run Node.cmd".

4. To install all necessary node libraries, type the following in the command prompt:

    npm install

    npm update             Update your node modules to newer versions
    npm run build          Compile and minify/uglify .min.css .min.js

# How To Make a Git Pull Request

If you are new to Git we recommend SourceTree or GitHub Desktop as a great graphical user interface for working with Git.

1. Fork the official LiteCart repository.

2. Use git clone to download the code from your forked repository.

    Example:
    git clone https://github.com/you/litecart.git
    git checkout dev

3. Create a new branch for your new feature or modification.

    Example:
    git checkout -b mynewfeature

4. Commit your changes and push it to your forked repository.

    Example:
    git commit -m "My commit of things"
    git push -u origin mynewfeature

5. Go to your forked repository in Github and click "Pull Requests" and the button "New Pull Request".

6. Set Base to the dev branch of the official repository.
   Set Head to your forked repository and the branch containing your new feature.

7. After creating the pull request. Do not implement new features to your branch, unless you have bugs that needs patching.

8. Once the pull request is accepted you can safely delete your feature branch.
